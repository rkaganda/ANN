Changes



Added methods to Node
 -you can now get references to both input and output links for a node

Added SigmaThreshold
	-When created a Node use the FeedForwardNetwork.addNode(Threshold t, int layerIndex) method.
	example addNode(new SigmaThreshold, 5) creates a Node that uses Sigma on layer 5
	
Added FeedForwardNetwork.linkLayers
 -Read the comments
 
Created FeedForwardNetworkTrainingLog and FeedForwardNetworkTrainingIteration
	-works the same as the old log classes just more flexible, 

Created FeedForwardNetworkTrainingMath
	-contains utility methods used for back propagation, probably needs some tweaking

Added FeedForwardNetwork.trainNetwork(TrainingDataPair dP) and trainLinkWeights(Node n, double error, int layerIndex, int nodeIndex)
	-Trains network using FeedForwardNetworkTrainingMath methods ... also logs. Read Comments

All Floats and floats are now Doubles and doubles.

--
PerceptronLogTableView logTable.getTableHeader().setReorderingAllowed(false);
	-You can no longer reorder columns.

Fixed a bug in FeedForwarNetwork.trainLinkWeights that might have caused a log offset issue. Every log row should match the length of the
first row.

Wrote FeedForwardTrainingLogTableModel.

Wrote FeedForwardTrainingLogViewPanel.

Fixed bug in FeedForwardNetwork.addLayer() - uses Vector.add(Object o) instead of Vector.add(int index, Object o) now.
Fixed bug in FeedForwardNetwork.linkLayers() - was using the nodeCount from the same layer twice instead of the layer and layer below.

TrainingDataViewPanel now generates a template TrainingDataSet if the FeedForwardNetwork dataSet is empty using 
TrainingDataViewPanel.generateTemplateDataSet

Wrote TrainingOptionPanel

Package ann.graph is now ann.ui.graph since graph is ui components.

Added FeedForwardNetworkGraphView.trainNetwork(int iterations, double errorThreshold) -sets the errorThreshold then iterates through the data set.

Added FeedForwardNetworkGraphView.currentMaxError - is updated in FeedForwardNetworkGraphView.trainNetwork(TrainingDataPair dP)

Finished TrainingOptionPanel - still need to add multithreading functionality so that iterations and error can be updated,
also so progress can be show. 

FeedForwardTrainingLogViewPanel now displays log data, however column names need to be fixed (TODO #5)

--

FeedForwardTrainingLog now uses node id as a key instead of node index and node layer index
FeedForwardTrainingLog now uses input node index and output node index as link keys

Added FeedForwardNodeIdTableView so you can now view nodes according to layer and id

FeedForwardNetwork logging now works correctly.

Changed trainNetwork(TrainingDataPair dP) to back propagate correctly. 

Added bias to Node.

Setting isActive to true in Node causes node to fire.

Calling FeedForwardNetwork.linkLayers sets all Nodes bias to 1.

Started FeedForwardNetworkTrainer.

FeedForwardNetworkTrainer now stores the network the that is being trained.

Removed TrainingDataSet.getDataPairs(). Added getDataPair(int index).

Removed data set viewing/modifications and log functionality from FeedForwardNetworkGraphView and added it to FeedForwardTrainingOptionPanel

FeedForwardNetwork no long stores a data set. Instead the data sets are stored in FeedForwardNetworkTrainer and FeedForwardTrainingFrame.

FeedForwardNetworkTrainer is now threaded.

Added live updating and stuff.

Removed bias, instead using weighted Nodes.

Fixed TrainingDataViewPanel so it does not generate input for WeightedNodes.

Added bias again.

Move the sigma function from the SigmaNode class to FeedForwardTrainingMath

Mode TrainingDataViewPanel to FeedForwardNetworkGraphView, this class now handles all training data input.

TrainingDataTableModel is now DataSetMode since all it does is display datasets. 
If the boolean value isTrainingData is false then all the output columns are locked.

TrainingDataTableModel now updates the training data set when you import a new data set. The only time the update button is need is if you manually
edit the training data. The update button is now the "Apply Changes" button.

TrainingDataPair and TrainingDataSet are now NetworkDataPair and NetworkDataSet. Package changed to ann.data to reflect this change.

Randomized the order of training data pairs for each iteration of the training data set.

Add momentum (see FeedForwardNetworkTrainer.trainLinkWeights)
