# Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN)

This repository provides a pure Java-based implementation of a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN). It's been built from scratch to assist with understanding the fundamental principles of neural networks.

## Features

- **Activation Function:** Utilizes the Sigmoid activation function.
- **Loss Calculation:** Employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Visualization:** Features a heatmap UI for visualizing the network's output across a 2D input space.
